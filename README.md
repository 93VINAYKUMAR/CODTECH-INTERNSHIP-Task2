## Objectives
The main purpose of a weather forecasting app is to help forecasters make accurate predictions without using their own judgment. The app uses meteorological parameters in formulas, graphs, tables, or algebraic forms to make objective forecasts. The app should have the same knowledge and techniques that an experienced forecaster would use to make decisions, and be able to coordinate previous meteorological events into a unified pattern.
